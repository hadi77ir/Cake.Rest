## Build

To build this library, we use [Cake](https://cakebuild.net/) and [Cake.Recipe](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Recipe).

On Windows PowerShell, run the bootstrapper through:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

or on Linux/macOS:
```
./build.sh
```

## Credits
- Jo√£o Antunes (Coding Militia) for [his great walkthrough on using Cake on CI/CD to publish a library to NuGet](http://https://blog.codingmilitia.com/2018/07/30/creating-ci-cd-pipeline-dotnet-library-part-02-defining-the-build-with-cake-publish-nuget). Code from example project used under MIT.

- [@phillipsj](https://github.com/phillipsj) for [Cake.Netlify](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Netlify), some Cake code and some parts of CI/CD configurations come from that repo.

- [The RestSharp Project](http://restsharp.org/), without RestSharp this would not be this easy.
